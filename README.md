## Usage:

There are two versions: the standard version and the AppCompat version (with Material Design).

#### Step: 1A - adding the library via Gradle

First of all add this to your root *build.gradle* file:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Now add the dependency to your app *build.gradle* file:

```
compile 'com.github.marcoscgdev:EasyLicensesDialog:2.0.0'
```

#### Step: 1B - adding the library via Jar file

Include [easylicensesdialog.jar](https://github.com/marcoscgdev/EasyLicensesDialog/tree/master/JAR) into your *libs* folder.

#### Step 2:
Edit the [licenses.html](https://github.com/marcoscgdev/EasyLicensesDialog/tree/master/app/src/main/assets) file and include it into your *assets* folder. Is **very important** that this file has the same name as here!

#### Step 3:
If you want to show the Easy Licenses Dialog, you can follow this snippet:

```java
new EasyLicensesDialogCompat(this)
                .setTitle("Licenses")
                .setPositiveButton(android.R.string.ok, null)
                .show();
```
