## Usage:

There are two versions: the standard version and the AppCompat version (with Material Design).

####Step: 1

First of all add this to your root *build.gradle* file:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Now add your prefered version to the app *build.gradle* file:

```
compile 'com.github.marcoscgdev.EasyLicensesDialog:appcompatversion:1.0.3'
```
or
```
compile 'com.github.marcoscgdev.EasyLicensesDialog:standardversion:1.0.3'
```

####Step 2:
Edit the [licenses.html](https://github.com/marcoscgdev/EasyLicensesDialog/tree/master/app/src/main/assets) file and include it into your _assets_ folder. Is **very important** that this file has the same name as here!

####Step 3:
If you want to show the Easy Licenses Dialog, you can follow this snippet:

```java
EasyLicensesDialog easyLicensesDialog = new EasyLicensesDialog(this);
        easyLicensesDialog.setTitle("Licenses"); //by default EasyLicensesDialog comes without any title.
        easyLicensesDialog.setCancelable(true); //true or false
        //easyLicensesDialog.setIcon(R.mipmap.ic_launcher); //add an icon to the title
        easyLicensesDialog.show(); //show the dialog
```
